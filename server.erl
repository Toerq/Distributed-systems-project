%% - Server module
%% - The server module creates a parallel registered process by spawning a process which 
%% evaluates initialize(). 
%% The function initialize() does the following: 
%%      1/ It makes the current process as a system process in order to trap exit.
%%      2/ It creates a process evaluating the store_loop() function.
%%      4/ It executes the server_loop() function.
